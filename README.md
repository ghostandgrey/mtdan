Much To-Do About Nothing

This is going to ultimately be my take on some sort of productivity/to-do list app.  I haven't finalised all the features I would like to support, let alone the style I am hoping to feature.

## Running
This currently requires you to include a `secrets.properties` file under the `resources` folder.  So far all it needs is a single property, `todoist.bearer.token=<todoist bearer token>`.  I am not committing it to Git for obvious reasons.

## Technology
Broadly, it will feature a Java-based back-end - perhaps one day ported over to Scala if I ever feel particularly ambitious - as well as a JavaScript front-end web app.  I am thinking either Angular 1 or Angular 2.  As of now I am undecided on which.
I am going to try and incorporate as many interesting technologies/practices I have come across at work as I can.  In no particular order, and probably to be added to in the future:

* Java
  * Lombok
  * MoreUnit
  * Spring
  * Hibernate?
  * TestNG
  * Mockito
  * Jackson
  * WireMock
  * Guava
* JavaScript
  * TypeScript?
  * Jasmine
  * Karma
  * Protractor
  * Angular 1/2
* General Web
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * Bootstrap
* Tools
  * Jira
  * Confluence
  * Vim
  * IntelliJ
  * Maven
  * Sonar
  * Flyway
  * TeamCity [Done]
* DB
  * Postgres
* Practices
  * TDD
